### Key Components
- **RaceList.vue** — orchestrates rendering of active races, applying sorting and expiry logic.
- **RaceColumn.vue** — displays individual race information with runners, odds, and betting controls.
- **CategoryFilter.vue** — handles toggling between racing categories with active state visuals.
- **CountdownTimer.vue** — isolated timer with proper interval cleanup and reactive updates.
- **BetPlacer.vue** — interactive betting interface for placing wagers on runners.
- **BetslipDrawer.vue** — slide-out panel for managing bet selections and placement.

### State Management

The Pinia stores manage different aspects of the application:

**src/stores/races.ts** manages:
- Races fetched from the API (GET https://api.neds.com.au/rest/v1/racing/?method=nextraces&count=10; Content-type: application/json)
  - Greyhound racing: category_id: '9daef0d7-bf3c-4f50-921d-8e818c60fe61'
  - Harness racing: category_id: '161d9be2-e909-4326-8c2c-35ed71fb460b'
  - Horse racing: category_id: '4a2788f8-e825-4d36-9894-efd4baf1cfae'
- Active category filter
- Loading and error states
- Derived getters for active and expired races

**src/stores/bets.ts** manages:
- Betting engine with virtual currency (1000 credits)
- Pending and settled bets
- Bankroll management
- Bet placement and settlement logic

**src/stores/simulation.ts** manages:
- Race simulation controllers
- Active race tracking
- Race status management

Data freshness is maintained via composables with setInterval, safely disposed on component unmount.

## 🎮 Simulation Mode (AI-Assisted Development)

RaceHub includes an advanced simulation mode co-developed with AI assistance that provides a realistic betting experience:

### Features
- **Real-time Odds Simulation**: Dynamic odds that fluctuate based on runner performance with realistic market movements (±0.5%)
- **Individualized Updates**: Odds updates based on each runner's position and progress
- **Market Dynamics**: Odds volatility changes based on race progress (early race: higher volatility, late race: lower volatility)
- **Betting Restrictions**: Realistic betting rules that prevent wagering once races start
- **Market Closure**: Automatic market closure when races begin
- **Configurable Limits**: Customizable betting limits per customer/product
- **Dead-Heat Rules**: Proper implementation of dead-heat rules for all bet types
- **Exotic Bet Settlement**: Enhanced settlement logic for QUINELLA, TRIFECTA, and FIRST_FOUR bets
- **Live Race Updates**: Real-time race progress information displayed in the header
- **Next Race Information**: Display of upcoming race details when no live races are running
- **Smooth Transitions**: Proper race status transitions from countdown to live to finished

### Technical Implementation
- **Betting Engine**: Custom TypeScript implementation with support for WIN, PLACE, EACH_WAY, MULTI, QUINELLA, TRIFECTA, and FIRST_FOUR bet types
- **Race Simulation Engine**: Deterministic race simulations with realistic pacing and outcomes
- **Odds Tracking**: Real-time tracking of odds changes for visualization
- **Odds History**: Storage of historical odds data for charting
- **Progressive Settlement**: Step-by-step settlement of multi-leg bets

## 🎨 Styling System

### Tailwind Configuration

Tailwind is extended with custom design tokens for semantic consistency:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      brand: {
        primary: '#F97316',
        secondary: '#0F172A',
        accent: '#FACC15'
      },
      surface: '#1E293B',
      text: {
        base: '#F8FAFC',
        muted: '#94A3B8'
      }
    },
    fontFamily: {
      sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif']
    }
  }
}
```

## 🧱 Accessibility
- ARIA labels on category buttons
- Keyboard navigation (Tab + Enter) supported
- Countdown timer announced via aria-live="polite"
- Skip links for keyboard users
- Proper color contrast ratios
- Focus indicators for interactive elements

## ✨ Bonus Implementations

- **Meetings View** — Added grouped view by meeting_name with sub-races accordion.
- **Theme Tokens** — Built design token SCSS maps → imported to Tailwind.
- **Skeleton Loaders** — Added shimmer placeholders while loading races.
- **Dark/Light Mode** — Persistent via localStorage toggle.
- **Betting Game Mode** — Interactive betting simulation with virtual currency.
- **Odds Visualization** — Real-time odds movement charts and trend indicators.
- **Responsive Layout** — Adapts to all screen sizes with mobile-first approach.
- **Internationalization** — Multi-language support with vue-i18n.

## 🧾 Known Limitations / Future Work
- API rate limiting not yet handled with exponential backoff.
- Internationalisation (i18n) partially implemented.
- Theme tokens could be extracted to external design system.

## 🧭 Author Notes

This implementation follows modern Vue 3 best practices with Composition API and TypeScript. The architecture is designed to be modular, testable, and maintainable.

Key design decisions:
- Used Pinia for state management for its simplicity and TypeScript support
- Implemented a composable pattern for reusable logic
- Created a clean component hierarchy with clear separation of concerns
- Implemented proper interval cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Added accessibility features following WCAG guidelines
- Used TailwindCSS for rapid UI development with a consistent design system
- Integrated a full betting simulation engine for enhanced user engagement
